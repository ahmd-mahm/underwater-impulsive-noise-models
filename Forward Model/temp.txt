500 waveforms, of length 182 samples

Assign waveform number to each Pr or ind_Rx

Evaluate the snap count observed at each index (snap_ind_Rx), select randomly the same amount of snaps, weigh them by their corresponding Pr and add.

Divide ind_Rx into K vectors, each of length samples, where K=max(snap_ind_Rx). This is done by recursively popping repetitive indices from snap_ind_Rx.

Pr_ts(i)=Pr(ind_Rx+1==i)


snap number can be deduced from t_ind_Tx, which in turn gives t_ind_Rx and t_ind_Rx_sr.

make the K x samples matrix from the N*T/(T-tau_min+tau_max)
